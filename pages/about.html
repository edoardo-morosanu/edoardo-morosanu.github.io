  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
  <p>My name is <strong>Edoardo Andrei Morosanu</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    I'm a software developer passionate about creating robust and efficient
    solutions. I like <strong>coding stuff</strong>, with a particular focus on
    solving complex logical challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main interests include <strong>Backend Development</strong> and
    <strong>Mobile Development</strong>, where I work with various technologies
    including Python, Rust, PHP, JavaScript, Vue.js, Flutter, and Java.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, I've developed a strong interest in
    <strong>Cybersecurity as well</strong>, particularly in red-teaming and penetration
    testing. I've been studying to become a pentester, and am looking forward to
    working in the field in the future.

  <p>
    Beyond coding, I'm a guitarist and have played in a band from 2021 to 2023.
